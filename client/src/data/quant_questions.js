Unfortunately, the first person in line is crazy, and will ignore the seat number on their ticket, picking a random seat to occupy. All of the other passengers are quite normal, and will go to their proper seat unless it is already occupied. If it is occupied, they will then find a free seat to sit in, at random.

This statement is true because the last person will either get the first seat or the last seat. All other seats will necessarily be taken by the time the last passenger gets to pick his/her seat.
