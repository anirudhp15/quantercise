This statement is true because the last person will either get the first seat or the last seat. All other seats will necessarily be taken by the time the last passenger gets to pick his/her seat.

We now have 1 gallon remaining in the 3 gallon jug. We empty the five gallon jug and pour the remaining 1 gallon into our 5 gallon jug.

Is this possible?",
